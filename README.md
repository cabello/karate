Karate Chop
===========

[CodeKata: Kata Two -- Karate Chop](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_two_karate.html) it's an
exercise proposed by Dave Thomas to practice programming.

The exercise is fairly simple, write **five** different implementations of the same algorithm, in this case the binary search algorithm.

For this exercise I used a language called [Go](http://golang.org), and my five implementations are:

- Channel
- Iterative
- Recursive
- Traditional
- Tree

You can run the tests with a simple ``go test`` in the cloned repo.
